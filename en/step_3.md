- You will receive an email from Twitter asking you to **confirm your email address**; follow the link in the email to confirm.

**Note**: once you confirm your email address, you need to wait for your application to be approved. This may take some time, and you can check the status of your application at [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com).
